# Go-SecureShell

Go-SecureShell is a play on my PowerShell [New-SecureShell](https://github.com/autoalan/newsecureshell) project and inspired by @ChrisWalz's excellent [bit](https://github.com/chriswalz/bit). Go-SecureShell leverages [go-prompt](https://github.com/c-bata/go-prompt) to autocomplete host connections from ~/.ssh/config. While it should work on Windows, Linux and similar platforms, the intent is nothing more than a fun project on a slow afternoon.
